Week-1	
OPERATORS AND EVALUATION OF EXPRESSIONS

a.	Write a C program to check whether a number is even or odd using ternary operator.

b.	Write a C program to perform the addition of two numbers without using + operator.

c.	Write a C program to evaluate the arithmetic expression ((a + b / c * d - e) * (f - g)). Read the values a, b, c, d, e, f, g from       the standard input device.

d.	Write a C program to find the sum of individual digits of a 3 digit number.

e.	Write a C program to read the values of x and y and print the results of the following expressions in one line:
    i.	(x + y) / (x - y)
    ii.	(x + y)(x - y)

CONTROL STRUCTURES

a.	Write a C program to find the sum of individual digits of a positive integer.

b.	A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first and second terms in the sequence are 0 and 1. Subsequent terms are found by         adding the preceding two terms in the sequence. Write a C program to generate the first n terms of the sequence.

c.	Write a C program to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is a value supplied by the user.

d.	A character is entered through keyboard. Write a C program to determine whether the character entered is a capital letter, a small         case letter, a digit or a special symbol using if-else and switch case. The following table shows the range of ASCII values for           various   characters.
    Characters	ASCII values
    A – Z	65 – 90
    a – z	97 – 122
    0 – 9	48 – 57
    Special symbols	0 – 47, 58 – 64, 91 – 96, 123 – 127
    
e. If cost price and selling price of an item is input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made        profit or incurred loss. Write a C program to determine how much profit or loss incurred in percentage.



Week-3	
CONTROL STRUCTURES

a.  Write a C program, which takes two integer operands and one operator from the user, performs the operation and then prints the           result. (Consider the operators +, -, *, /, % and use switch statement).

b.	Write a C program to calculate the following sum:
    sum = 1 – x2 /2! + x4 /4! – x6 /6! +x8 /8! – x10/10!
    
c.	Write a C program to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

d.	Write a C program to check whether a given 3 digit number is Armstrong number or not.

e.	Write a C program to print the numbers in triangular form
    1
    1	2
    1	2	3
    1	2	3	4
